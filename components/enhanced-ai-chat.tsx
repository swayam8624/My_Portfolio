His Memory Retrieval Cue framework is genuinely groundbreaking - he's using CNN+LSTM architectures on EEG data to predict memory recall with 27% better accuracy than existing methods.

His multi-agent systems work is equally impressive, especially the CrewAI implementation that reduced manual intervention by 60%. üöÄ",

Plus, his work bridges neuroscience and AI in really innovative ways! ü§ñ",

It's like he's building bridges between the weird quantum world and our classical computers! ‚öõÔ∏è",
